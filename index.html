            The history of chess can be traced back nearly 1500 years to its
            earliest known predecessor, called chaturanga, in India; its
            prehistory is the subject of speculation. From India it spread to
            Persia. Following the Arab invasion and conquest of Persia, chess
            was taken up by the Muslim world and subsequently spread to southern
            Europe. The game evolved roughly into its current form by about 1500
            CE.

            "Romantic chess" was the predominant playing style from the late
            18th century to the 1880s.[1] Chess games of this period emphasized
            quick, tactical maneuvers rather than long-term strategic
            planning.[1] The Romantic era of play was followed by the
            Scientific, Hypermodern, and New Dynamism eras.[1] In the second
            half of the 19th century, modern chess tournament play began, and
            the first official World Chess Championship was held in 1886. The
            20th century saw great leaps forward in chess theory and the
            establishment of the World Chess Federation. In 1997, an IBM
            supercomputer beat Garry Kasparov, the then world chess champion, in
            the famous Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov match, ushering the game
            into an era of computer domination. Since then, computer analysis –
            which originated in the 1970s with the first programmed chess games
            on the market – has contributed to much of the development in chess
            theory and has become an important part of preparation in
            professional human chess. Later developments in the 21st century
            made the use of computer analysis far surpassing the ability of any
            human player accessible to the public. Online gaming, which first
            appeared in the mid-1990s, also became popular in the 21st century.
